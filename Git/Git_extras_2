error.log                                                                                         to ignore a specific file
*.log                                                                                             to ignore all .log file
dir/                                                                                              to ignore a directory
/dir/                                                                                             to ignore a directory only in the parent folder

if a file isn't ignoring by git ignore run this command
git rm -cached <filename>
