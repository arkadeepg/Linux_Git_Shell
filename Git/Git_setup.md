This article explains how to generate SSH keys for GitHub, so you don't have to enter your credentials every time.

1. Generate SSH key:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

2. Add SSH key to GitHub account:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

3. Once above steps are completed, use "SSH" to clone your Git repo rather than HTTPS.

`git clone git@github.com:<user/repo.git>`
